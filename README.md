- Take an input file (itcont.txt) that lists campaign contributions by individual donors and distill it into two output files:
- Input file: Each line of the input file contains information about a campaign contribution that was made on a particular date from a donor to a political campaign, committee or other similar entity
- Ouput files: ./output/medianvals_by_zip.txt and ./output/medianvals_by_date.txt
1. medianvals_by_zip.txt: contains a calculated running median, total dollar amount and total number of contributions by recipient and zip code
2. medianvals_by_date.txt: has the calculated median, total dollar amount and total number of contributions by recipient and date.
